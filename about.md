The iCEBreaker FPGA project aims to be a low cost, open-source educational FPGA development platform.

The main motivating application of this platform is for classes and workshops
teaching the use of the open source FPGA design flow using
[Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/),
[nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr),
[icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/),
[iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/),
[symbiflow](https://github.com/SymbiFlow) and others. This means the boards have
to be low cost and have a nice set of features to allow for the design of
interesting classes and workshop exercises. At the same time we want to allow
the user to use the proprietary vendor tools if they choose to. Because of that
we need to be compatible with their firmware upload tools.

iCEBreaker is an open-source project. You can find the hardware at GitHub:
